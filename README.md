1. AdminServlet.java which will respond to the URL localhost:port#/admin. This is intended for
an administrator login and corresponding functionality for JZ Airlines.
2. CustomerServlet.java which will respond to the URL localhost:port#/customer This is
intended for passengers on JZ Airlines

Each of these will be called from JZWebServer.java that you will use as your webserver.

There will be two landing pages that go with each of the above:
1. The administrator login page is called adminlogin.html.
2. The customer login page is called customerlogin.html.
